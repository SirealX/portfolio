# Welcome to My Portfolio! 🚀

Hello! I'm a third-year Computer Science student with a deep love for technology and learning. This portfolio is a mix of professional and personal projects, where I aim to showcase my growth and passion for the tech world. **It's the first time I’m putting something out on GitHub, so it's a big milestone for me!**

### 👤 Who Am I?
I’ve been fascinated by technology for as long as I can remember. My journey started with microcontrollers and working with PCBs, and gradually evolved into a love for coding, problem-solving, and exploring how both hardware and software come together.

I’m currently learning a lot about coding, data analysis with Python (Pandas, NumPy), networking, and web development. I'm also dipping my toes into Astro, TypeScript, and JavaScript for the first time. I’m still getting comfortable with these new technologies, but I’m excited to grow.

At my core, I'm a curious learner. My background in tech has always been more hands-on, and now, I'm focused on expanding my knowledge of software development, robotics, and data science. I see this portfolio as a place where I can document my learning, showcase my work, and continuously improve my skills.

### 📂 What to Expect From My Portfolio
This is where I’ll display everything from web development projects to data analysis, networking, and eventually some robotics. Right now, it’s a little bit of everything—because I’m still figuring out exactly where I want to focus my efforts.

* **E-Commerce Project:** My primary focus at the moment is learning how to build a sustainable e-commerce platform. This is the project I’m most excited about and will be dedicating my time to during the holidays.
* **Personal Projects:** I have a few side projects in mind, including a macro tracking app for gym enthusiasts, an APOS checking system, and a budgeting tool. These are in the works but aren’t featured yet.
* **Web Development:** A mix of front-end and back-end development, mainly using Astro, JavaScript, TypeScript, and a bit of PHP.
* **Learning Robotics:** I’ve recently started learning about Arduino and robotics, and will hopefully be showcasing some of my experiments here as well.

### 🎯 Current Focus & What’s Next
Right now, my focus is on building a fully-functional e-commerce website. This is my first major web development project, and I’m learning a lot along the way. My goal is to make the site scalable and responsive, while also understanding how to manage products, handle payments, and improve user experience.

As a student, I’m still figuring out my exact direction, but I’m open to trying out new technologies, tools, and ideas as I go.

### 📩 Contact and Collaboration
I’m always open to collaboration and freelance work. While I’m still relatively new to the field, I’m eager to learn from others and contribute to projects where I can grow. If you’re a mentor or have advice to offer, I’d greatly appreciate it!

### 🙏 Acknowledgements
A big thank you to the amazing YouTube channels, documentation sites, and online communities that have helped me along the way. I’ve mostly been self-taught and learned a lot through trial and error, and I’m grateful for the resources available.

**I’m still early in my journey, and I know there’s so much more to learn. But I’m excited to be doing it, and I hope that as I continue to grow, this portfolio will reflect that journey. Thanks for checking it out!**
